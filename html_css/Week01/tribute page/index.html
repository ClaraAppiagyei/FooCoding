          <h3>About Feijoada</h3>
          <p><strong>Brazilian Feijoada</strong> is a black bean and pork stew that is often served with farofa, toasted cassava flour. This comfort food is sometimes called the national dish of Brazil. Feijoada, a popular Brazilian dish, owes its name to its main ingredient, black beans (feijão). It is a rich stew traditionally made from different parts of the pig, such as feet, ears, and bacon, as well as other smoked meats. </p>
		
						<p><strong>Brazilian cuisine</strong> is very regionalized, each region has its own typical dishes. This is the result of a mixture of different European, Indigenous, and  West African ingredients and influences.In the northeast region of Brazil, there is a great influence of West African cuisine. In the northern region, there is a greater influence of the Natives, where the use of cassava and fish come in to play in many of their dishes. In the southeast region of Brazil, there are diverse dishes linked to the Bandeirantes (bandits) that include ingredients like corn, beans, and pork. In the south region, Italian cuisine has a great influence on dishes such as polenta and pizza. And we also see the influence of German cuisine.</p>

          <strong>Instructions:</strong>
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl with water, soak beans overnight. </li>
            <li>When you are ready to make your stew, in a large heavy-bottom soup pot, over medium heat, add the oil and bacon. Cook until crisp and transfer to a plate. </li>
            <li>Use the same saucepan to brown ribs and sausages in batches. (You will want to be sure to cook the sliced chorizo on its own, as it can be very greasy. Drain the grease before continuing.) Set each aside as cooked. </li>
            <li>If needed, add more oil to the pan. On medium-high, sauté onion and garlic until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook for another 3 minutes. </li>
            <li>Drain and rinse the soaked beans. Add them to the pot along with the ribs, bacon, sausages, salt, pepper, bay leave. Cover with water (about 8 cups). </li>
            <li>Bring the mixture to a boil and reduce the heat to low. Cover and let it cook for 2 to 2 and a half hours, or until the beans are soft. </li>
            <li>If the stew is too liquidy, uncover the saucepan and continue to cook for another 20 minutes to allow some of the liquid to evaporate. </li>
            <li>Serve with white rice and sprinkle some farofa on top. </li>
          </ol>
